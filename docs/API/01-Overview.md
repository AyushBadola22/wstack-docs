# Overview
## Introduction

Our API is built using **Hono**, a fast and lightweight web framework designed to handle API requests efficiently. The API adheres to **RESTful principles**, ensuring a consistent and intuitive interface for users. It integrates **Redis** for rate limiting and caching, enhancing performance and preventing abuse. The architecture is structured to be easily extendable and secure.

## Features

### 1. **Hono Framework**
- **Lightweight and Fast**: Hono is optimized for speed and minimal overhead, making it ideal for serverless environments like Cloudflare Workers.
- **Web Standards Compliance**: Built on web standards, Hono ensures compatibility across different platforms.

### 2. **Protected Routes**
- **Security via Middlewares**: The API uses middlewares to protect routes from unauthorized access. This includes authentication and authorization checks to ensure only authorized users can access sensitive data.

### 3. **Redis-based Rate Limiting**
- **Preventing Abuse**: Redis is used to implement rate limiting, preventing excessive requests from a single source and protecting against potential attacks.

### 4. **Authentication Middleware**
- **Protecting Routes**: Authentication middleware ensures that only authenticated users can access protected routes.

### 5. **Integration with TanStack Query**
- **Efficient Data Fetching and Mutations**: TanStack Query is used to optimize data fetching and mutations, reducing unnecessary requests and improving overall performance.

## Base URL

The base URL of the API varies depending on the environment:

- **Development**: `http://localhost:3000/api`
- **Production**: `<your-deployed-url>/api`
