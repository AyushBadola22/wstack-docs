## Common Issues

Below are some common issues you might encounter while working with NextAuth.js, along with their solutions:

### 1. Environment Variables Not Working

**Symptoms**:

- Your app fails to recognize environment variables like `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` or provider credentials.
- Authentication providers return errors.

**Solution**:

1. Ensure your `.env.local` file is created in the root of your project.
2. Add the required variables in the following format:
   ```env
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key
   GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
   GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
   ```
3. Restart your development server after making changes.

### 2. Session Not Persisting

**Symptoms**:

- Users are logged out unexpectedly.
- Session data is not saved across page reloads.

**Solution**:

1. Verify that `NEXTAUTH_URL` is set correctly in your `.env.local` file.
   ```env
   NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```
2. Check your cookie settings in the NextAuth.js configuration. Ensure cookies are secure and configured for your environment (e.g., `secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === "production"`).

### 3. Provider Errors

**Symptoms**:

- Authentication fails with errors like "Invalid credentials" or "Provider not found."

**Solution**:

1. Double-check your provider credentials (e.g., `Client ID` and `Client Secret`).
2. Ensure the callback URL in your provider’s dashboard matches the one in your NextAuth.js configuration.
3. For OAuth providers, ensure you’ve enabled the required permissions (e.g., `email`, `profile`).

### 4. Redirect URI Mismatch

### Q: How do I add a new OAuth provider?

**A**: Adding a new OAuth provider is simple:

1. Go to the provider’s developer console (e.g., [Google](https://console.cloud.google.com/), [GitHub](https://github.com/settings/developers)).
2. Create a new OAuth application and obtain the `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.
3. Add the provider to your NextAuth.js configuration:

   ```javascript
   import GitHubProvider from "next-auth/providers/github";

   export const authOptions = {
     providers: [
       GitHubProvider({
         clientId: process.env.GITHUB_CLIENT_ID,
         clientSecret: process.env.GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET,
       }),
     ],
   };
   ```
