# Database Overview

This document provides an overview of the database used in the project. The database is a critical component of the application, responsible for storing and retrieving data.

## Database Type

The project uses a relational database management system (RDBMS) to store data. The chosen RDBMS is PostgreSQL, which is known for its robustness, scalability, and support for advanced features.

## Key Features

- ACID compliance
- Support for complex queries
- Indexing for fast data retrieval
- Support for transactions
- Data integrity and consistency

## Architecture

The database architecture consists of the following components:

- **Tables**: Store data in rows and columns.
- **Indexes**: Improve the speed of data retrieval.
- **Views**: Provide a way to present data in a specific format.
- **Stored Procedures**: Encapsulate business logic within the database.
- **Triggers**: Automatically execute actions in response to certain events.

## Backup and Recovery

Regular backups are performed to ensure data is not lost in case of a failure. The backup strategy includes:

- Full backups every week
- Incremental backups every day
- Storing backups in a secure, off-site location

## Security

The database is secured using the following measures:

- Strong passwords for database users
- Role-based access control
- Encryption of sensitive data
- Regular security audits
